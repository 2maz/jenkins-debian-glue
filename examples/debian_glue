# Example configuration file for the jenkins-debian-glue software.
# Install this file as /etc/jenkins/debian_glue to enable it.

# Set GnuPG ID that should be used for signing the reprepro repository.
# Expected format: DEADBEEF
# KEY_ID=

# If TRUNK_RELEASE is set then the package(s) of the repository
# receiving the packages that are built will be copied to the
# repository specified in TRUNK_RELEASE. This provides the option
# to have all recent versions of packages in a central repository.
# TRUNK_RELEASE='release-trunk'

# If packages are build for more than one architecture you can
# decide which architecture should build the "Architecture: all"
# packages. On all other architectures only the arch specific
# packages will be build then.
# If unset it will default to the architecture of the host system.
# MAIN_ARCHITECTURE="amd64"

# Hook scripts for pbuilder/cowbuilder, used e.g. for autopkgtest.
# Default:
# PBUILDER_HOOKDIR=/usr/share/jenkins-debian-glue/pbuilder-hookdir/

# Path to the main reprepro repository
# Default:
# REPOSITORY='/srv/repository'

# You can define every reprepro directory separately.
# $REPOSITORY is used as the base directory (+b), visit
# man reprepro(1) for further details
# Defaults:
# REPOSITORY_OUT_DIR='+b'
# REPOSITORY_CONF_DIR='+b/conf'
# REPOSITORY_DIST_DIR='+o/dists'
# REPOSITORY_LOG_DIR='+b/logs'
# REPOSITORY_DB_DIR='+b/db'
# REPOSITORY_LIST_DIR='+b/lists'
# REPOSITORY_MORGUE_DIR='+b/morgue'

# Iff the environment variable 'release' is set then by default
# ${REPOSITORY}/release/${release} is used instead of just ${REPOSITORY}.
# If you do not want to separate release reprepro repositories
# or use a different one you can override that via RELEASE_REPOSITORY
# Default:
# RELEASE_REPOSITORY="${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}"
