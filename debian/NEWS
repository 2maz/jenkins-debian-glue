jenkins-debian-glue (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The timestamp format used in automatically generated version
  strings changed.

  Until and including version 0.5.0 jenkins-debian-glue's
  generate-git-snapshot and generate-svn-snapshot scripts used
  "seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" inside the version
  string.  The new timestamp format YYYYMMDDhhmmss (in UTC) sorts
  equally well as unix timestamp and yet it is much more usable
  for human beings. As this timestamp change still increases the
  version numbers the change does NOT break any existing setups,
  but to avoid confusion it's worth noting.
